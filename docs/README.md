# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This guide provides an introduction to our structured, yet adaptable approach to delivering cross-functional projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme adopts a comprehensive project management framework that segments the project lifecycle into distinct phases: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Each phase includes specific deliverables and decision points to ensure stakeholder alignment and successful outcomes. Projects begin with a validated one-pager and stakeholder alignment, proceed through backlog and milestone planning, and are executed using iterative tracking via Kanban-style boards and regular reviews.

Roles are clearly defined across the organization. Product Managers drive vision and prioritization, Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, Developers implement features with a focus on testability and quality, QA ensures quality standards are met, and Stakeholders provide essential inputs and validation throughout the process. This clear delineation of responsibilities enables effective collaboration and accountability. Regular communication cycles promote transparency and engagement across all stakeholders, including daily standups for immediate coordination, weekly syncs for alignment, demos to showcase progress, and monthly updates for broader organizational visibility.

Quality assurance is embedded into every phase of the project lifecycle. Requirements include automated and manual testing, security scans, and clearly defined release criteria. Pre-release gates, structured deployment protocols, and consistent retrospectives support system reliability and continuous improvement.

These cross-functional practices foster customer-first outcomes, clear ownership, and data-informed decision-making, creating an environment of accountability, learning, and ongoing refinement.

## Getting Started

If you're new to OctoAcme project management:

1. Start with the **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** to understand our principles and approach
2. Review **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** to understand your responsibilities and how you interact with others
3. Follow the process documents in sequence when starting a new project: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective

## Using These Documents

- Keep project-specific artifacts (charters, backlogs, risk registers) in your project repository
- Reference these process documents as templates and guidelines
- Add process-specific documentation to `.copilot/` directories if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context
- Adapt these processes as needed for your specific project while maintaining the core principles
